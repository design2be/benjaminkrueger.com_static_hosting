      "details": "<b>MVP idea (auto-insert scope):</b>\nBuild a lightweight browser extension that detects when a user focuses a comment field, opens a small popover with a few reply-style options, generates 3–5 context-aware suggestions, and pastes the selected suggestion directly into the active input field.\n\n<br><br><b>User flow:</b>\n\n<br>1. User clicks the comment/reply field they want to respond to.\n\n<br>2. A popover appears next to the field with reply-style buttons and suggested replies.\n\n<br>3. The user clicks a suggestion and it’s automatically inserted into the comment field (editable before posting).\n<br/><br/>The tool removes the friction of figuring out what to say by instantly turning context into ready-to-post replies, saving time, reducing social anxiety, and helping users consistently respond with the right tone—whether they want to be thoughtful, witty, professional, or diplomatic.",
